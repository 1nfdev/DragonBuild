# DragonBuild
Much faster ninja-based tweak compiler

DragonBuild currently requires an existing Theos implementation. This will eventually be written out. Currently it will detect your installation via environment variables, so you shouldn't need to worry too much about this :)

DragonBuild uses logos.pl from Theos. You will need to import headers that theos auto-imports yourself. That will likely not change, as it's good practice to do so. 

## Notes

* This was built for MacOS. It needs a lot of work and a lot less hard-coding to work on linux. We'll get there, I promise :)

## Basic Usage

`dragon [gen] [build] [clean] [install]`

`dragon gen` Generate the ninja build file

`dragon build` Build the project

`dragon clean` Force a rebuild even when no changes are detected

`dragon install` Install the project to the device located at `$DRAGONDEVICEIP`

## Setting your project up for DragonBuild

### Creating a DragonMake File

DragonBuild uses DragonMake files as a stand-in replacement for Makefiles. 

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|   |   |   |

Example DragonMake files for a Tweak and a SubTweak can be found in ./ExampleProject

### Generating the build script

This is crucial. Whenever your DragonMake file is updated (or you pull upstream changes from DragonBuild), you need to run `dragon gen` (`dragon g`, if you're lazy)

You only need to do this when the DragonMake file is updated. 

### Building and installing your Tweak

`dragon build` to build (`dragon make` and `dragon b` also work)

`dragon install` to install (`dragon i` also works)

### Forcing a rebuild

DragonBuild will hash the contents of your tweak directory and only rebuild whenever it detects a change. If you want to force a rebuild despite having no changes, append `clean` to your command. 

# Installing DragonBuild

`brew install ninja`

Choose the directory to install DragonBuild in. cd to it, then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KritantaDev/DragonBuild.git
```

Then, add the following to your ~/.bash_profile (or whatever you use)  
`export DRAGONBUILD=path/for/DragonBuild`  
`alias dragon=$DRAGONBUILD/dragon`  

DragonBuild currently requires a Theos installation at $THEOS

# Under the Hood

DragonBuild stemmed from my attempt (purely out of boredom, in all honesty) to compile a tweak using a build.ninja file. There was absolutely no documentation on doing so whatsoever, since everyone seems to use GNU Make + Theos for building since iOS 4>. After getting a tweak running, I decided to try and create a Theos replacement/augmentation that generates ninja files and builds from those. 

## Ninja Build file gen Proccess

Currently, DragonBuild uses an incredibly elementary method of template build.ninja files and `sed` macros to fill these out. The "DragonMake" file acts as a bash source script and defines some variables we first escape, and then pass to sed. 

Once we have a ninja file, we're set. You can compile a dylib now using `ninja`. The generated ninja file will also sign it. 

This isn't quite enough for a complete package though; we still need to copy over our .plist, control file, subprojects, and such into a directory structure. We then use dpkg-deb to build it, and scp to install. ez pz. 

Currently, ninja handles compiling, linking, and signing. Ideally, ninja will handle everything. ninja allows bash commands, so it is only limited by its generator. 

I hope to see the complexity of DragonBuild's ninja generator increase, and the complexity of the rest of DragonBuild decrease, as ninja is much better suited to most of this.
