# dragonhook.py
# Python seemed like the best language for this. Every platform tends to come with it preinstalled,
# save windows, but even windows makes it incredibly easy to install. 

# dragonhook revolutionizes hooking syntax, opting for objc based syntax that tries to
#   bridge the gap between logos and the output logos generates. 

# Since logos has become the 'de facto' way to write tweaks, all versions of dragonbuild
#   should still support Logos, and DragonHook will never be pushed as a replacement, only
#   as an alternative

# Processing with dragonhook saves a negligible amount of time by merely changing syntax, not 
#   the entire structure.
